# AIRBUS A320 BRAKING SYSTEM MODEL

## Overview
This project is a simulation of the braking system of the Airbus A320 aircraft. The project is implemented in arduino and proteus design suite. The project is divided into two parts:
1. **Hardware Implementation**: The hardware implementation is done using the arduino microcontroller. The arduino is interfaced with the proteus design suite to simulate the braking system. The hardware implementation is done using the following components:
    - ATMEGA328P
    - 16x2 LCD
    - 4x4 Keypad
    - Servo Motor
    - DC Motor
    - Potentiometer
    - Push Button
    - LED
    - Buzzer
    - 12V Power Supply
    - 5V Power Supply
    - 9V Power Supply
    - 3V Power Supply
2. **Software Implementation**: The software implementation is done using the arduino IDE. The software is written in C++/arduino and is uploaded to the ATMEGA microcontroller. The software is responsible for controlling the hardware components and simulating the braking system.


>NOTE: The project is not yet implemented fully. The project is still in the development phase.
